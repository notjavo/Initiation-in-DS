Wow heyo what is up Github. Let me just say I am new to all of this... and I am excited to learn! 
Be kind, love everyone, and be true to yourself.

For my classmates, lets connect! Just to keep things somewhat safe because at the end of the day this is a public repo, HMU through the group me chat and we can exchange #'s and get to work!
