# Initiation-in-DS
Wow heyo what is up Github. Let me just say I am new to all of this... and I am excited to learn! 
Be kind, love everyone, and be true to yourself.

For my classmates, lets connect! Just to keep things somewhat safe because at the end of the day this is a public repo, HMU through the group me chat and we can exchange #'s and get to work! 
This new change has been made by connecting my git hub account to my visual. This may have taken me a while but OMG does it feel rewarding to finally figure this out. At first I was frustrated with the format of how the orientation was laid out but now I understand the importance of pushing through the tough because it really makes you learn.
